3. I would describe myself as a hardworking person. My strong point is my ability to learn quickly and efficiently. I am a bit of a perfectionist. Sometimes when I am working on a big project, I ficus too much on the details. At the current moment, I suppose that my hobby is React. It’s not only the process of learning the library for me. I like reading a documentation,watching videos  on Telegram and YouTube.

5. You can look at code examples on github (https://github.com/batashofa)  or Сodewars (https://www.codewars.com/users/batashofa).   
   An example of solving "the Calculate Variance" problem on Сodewars:
```
   var variance = function (numbers) {
   let sum = 0;
   let sum1 = 0;
   numbers.forEach((n)=> {
   sum += n/(numbers.length);
   })
   numbers.forEach((n)=> {
   sum1 += (Math.pow((n - sum), 2))/numbers.length;
   })
   return sum1;    
   } 
```
