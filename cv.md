3. I would describe myself as a hardworking person. My strong point is my ability to learn quickly and efficiently. I am a bit of a perfectionist. Sometimes when I am working on a big project, I ficus too much on the details. At the current moment, I suppose that my hobby is React. Itâ€™s not only the process of learning the library for me. I like reading a documentation,watching videos  on Telegram and YouTube.
